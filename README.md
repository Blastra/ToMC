Weapons of Mass Creation

NOTE: Currently server functionality achieved only on Linux.

The server must have the ports 8098, 8099 and 9001 open to be able to host a
game.

You may need to make the server scripts found in the Extra_python_modules executable by doing 'chmod a+x HTTPServerstuff.py'

Weapons of Mass Creation is a game on the Blender game engine. Reshape the forms you create. Build worlds with these forms. Connect the worlds.

The networking should work on your machine out of the box.
